May Morris remarked, “You can picture my Father going out in the early morning and watching the rascally thrushes at work on the fruit beds and telling the gardener who growls, ‘I’d like to wring their necks!’ that no bird in the garden must be touched.” With <em>Strawberry Thief, </em>Morris perfected the indigo-discharge process, which required the entire cloth to be dyed blue before it was bleached and block printed, in this case with more colors than any of his other textiles.",

He described <em>Porgy</em> (1927) as his favorite print and was inspired after seeing a play by the same name at the Ohio Theatre. Elongated and slumping figures convey the narrative’s emotional climax, about a man’s attempts to rescue his love from her violent partner.

Guy Cowan, brought Gregory to Cleveland from Chicago, where he was developing a reputation as a talented young sculptor. Cowan Pottery, located in Lakewood (1912–17) and later Rocky River (1919–32), Ohio, began producing ceramic sculpture in the mid-1920s, launching its most fertile creative period. Cowan employed a large team of talented artists at the studio, including Walter Sinz, Thelma Frazier Winter, and Viktor Schreckengost. The studio brought national fame to Cleveland ceramists, but was forced to close due to economic circumstances in 1932.",

According to the Bible, it was Eve who offered Adam the apple which led to mankind's downfall, ushering sin and death into the world. Adam's loincloth indicates that he has become ashamed of his nudity, a sign of his fall from grace. This startling role reversal reflects Cowan's belief that men are more prone to moral temptation than women. In addition to its innovative iconography, the sculpture's rich color and elegant, rhythmic forms establish it as Cowan's finest work and a masterpiece of the American Art Deco aesthetic. Born to a family of potters in East Liverpool, Ohio, Cowan directed the Cowan Pottery studios in Lakewood (1912-17) and Rocky River (1919-32), Ohio. Cowan Pottery was among the foremost producers of American Art Deco pottery and ceramic sculpture. Cowan recruited many talented artists to work in his studios, including Thelma Frazier Winter, Edward Winter, Walter Sinz, Waylande Gregory, and Viktor Schreckengost.",

Likely inspired by similar compositions in modern photography, these images are not only celebrations of nature, but also striking essays in abstract design. Although many critics interpreted O'Keeffe's flower paintings as reflections of femininity in general and female sexuality in particular, the artist strongly opposed such readings. Throughout most of her career, she frequently attempted to persuade others to discuss her work without referring to her gender, writing on one occasion, \"I have always been very annoyed at being referred to as a 'woman artist' rather than an 'artist.'\"",

      "description": "<em>Peony</em> was probably designed for Morris &amp; Co. by Kate Faulkner, the sister of William Morris’s early business partner Charles Faulkner. The small, almost square repeat of this pattern is more characteristic of Kate than of Morris, who favored larger patterns. She also designed embroidery, wallpaper, painted tiles and pottery, and plaster decoration for the firm. Morris had a progressive attitude toward women as co-laborers, and promoted the work of designers such as Kate, whose patterns challenged the monotony of much of the needlework and domestic crafts that then occupied middle-class women.",

      "description": "Among Morris’s first designs for printing on fabric, <em>Marigold</em> was originally intended for use on wallpaper, as seen in the image below. It was one of only a few patterns that clients could buy as both textile and wallpaper; it was also printed on linoleum. The wide variety of media available in <em>Marigold</em> speaks to the broad decorative application of its lively organic pattern. Here, blossoms and vines spread with ordered freedom, generating a sense of movement and demonstrating Morris’s revolutionary principle of “rational growth,” which set his designs apart from the formal, rigid patterns of his competitors.",

      "description": "Morris said that he used the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum) more than anyone alive. As one of the most knowledgeable textile historians of his day, Morris filtered his love of nature through the lens of history. Later textiles with strong diagonal orientation, such as <em>Kennet,</em> show a debt to the centuries-old Italian cut velvet that he had studied. Named after a river in the south of England that flows into the Thames, <em>Kennet</em> is an example of one of his patterns that could be purchased in a variety of colors and fabrics, including cotton, velveteen, silk, and Madras muslin, creating limitless possibilities to appeal to consumers’ needs and tastes.",

      "description": "When Morris designed <em>Snakeshead</em> in 1877, Indian silks were in style and widely imported from British India. This design stands out for its diminutive motifs and the strong red and black colors, which were fashionable only for a short time before paler hues regained favor with clients. While its color scheme suggests distant lands with warmer climates, the pattern showcases one of Morris’s favorite flowers: the fritillary, a wildflower that he remembered growing in the meadows near Oxford.",
